# RAG Based Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to explore how conversational AI can be improved for a better userâ€“bot experience. 
The chatbot is capable of reading and understanding PDF documents, allowing users to ask context-based questions and engage in interactive one-on-one conversations. It integrates modules such as LangChain, Google Generative AI, Streamlit, PyPDF, along with custom functions and prompt engineering to enhance response quality.
The application is deployed online using Streamlit, making it easily accessible through a simple and interactive web interface.
